Coding is the only craft I revere like I do poetry. I want to make it my career so that, after some years, I’ll be able to apply what I know of poetry to Natural Language Processing.

It would be corny to say that coding is the same, and it isn’t. Coding is entirely not about yourself. It’s not about parts of you that you don’t know.

As much as anything, my time there has shown me how commitment multiplies the depth and possibility of a relationship.

I started out on a shared server on BlueHost, and now I've got a VPS while I build up to higher degrees of abstraction and serverlessness.
