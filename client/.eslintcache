In summer 2020, I earned my Master’s degree, and by August I was enrolled in General Assembly, pursuing my next evolution. Coding is the only craft I love like I love poetry. I want to make it my career so that, after some years, I’ll be able to apply what I know of poetry to Natural Language Processing. I'm reading the books. A lot of poets are still looking backward in time.

The poem, between the me who wrote it and the me who read it, created a message new to me. In that poem, I saw parts of me I hadn’t known. It would be corny to say that coding is the same, and it isn’t. Coding is entirely not about yourself. It’s not about parts of you that you don’t know. It’s about what of the world that you don’t know. The humility of remembering how little I know has got me sick with the need to study, practice, produce, and know more about the fiery potential of our friendly personal PCs.\";\n  const journalismBio = \"I started working with GAYLETTER four years ago, just writing online about artists I liked.

As much as anything, my time there has shown me how commitment multiplies the depth and possibility of a relationship.

I started out on a shared server on BlueHost, and now I've got a VPS while I build up to higher degrees of abstraction and serverlessness.
